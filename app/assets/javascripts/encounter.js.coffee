An Encounter is an interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a
practitioner who is vested with primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating,
or treating the patient's condition. It may include visits, appointments, as well
as non face-to-face interactions. It is also a contact between a patient and a
practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the
patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment.
